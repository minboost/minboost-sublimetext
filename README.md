Snippets, Themes and Customization for SublimeText2
===================================================

This is my personal collection of customizations I use when working with SublimeText2.


Installation
------------

+ Copy / download this repository into a subfolder in your SublimeText Packages folder.
  + On OSX, this is typically _~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/_
  + I name my folder _User-minboost_
