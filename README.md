SublimeText2 Customizations
===================================================

This is my personal collection of customizations I use when working with SublimeText2.

### Snippets
The majority of files are snippets, somewhat organized by naming convention.

### Build System
There is a PHP build system that will run lint (`php -l`) when building a PHP file.

### Themes
There is one theme, which is an inverted color scheme (gray text on black background) that is easy on the eyes.

### Other
The Icon.png file is used as an icon for the repo if you're using [Towerapp][http://www.git-tower.com/].

Installation
------------

+ Copy, or download, this repository into a subfolder in your SublimeText Packages folder
  + On OSX, this is typically _~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/_
  + I name my folder _User-minboost_, but you can name it whatever you want

Some snippets were taken, or inspired, from others that I found online.
